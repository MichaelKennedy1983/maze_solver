<h1 id="maze-solver">Maze Solver</h1>
<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>A short program which solves mazes using various algorithms and written
in Rust. It is adapted from Dr. Mike Pound's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI">video</a>
for Computerphile and Python <a href="https://github.com/mikepound/mazesolving">code</a>.
My goal with this project was to practice using the Rust language and reacquaint myself with search algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="build">Build</h2>
<p>Assuming Rust's build tool and package manager, Cargo, is already
installed:<br />
1. clone repository<br />
2. change directory to the cloned repository<br />
3. run 'cargo build' in the repository directory  </p>
<h2 id="run">Run</h2>
<p>maze_solver input [-a algorithm] [-o output directory]</p>
<h2 id="input">Input</h2>
<p>Taken from Dr. Pound's documentation:<br />
- Each maze is black and white. White represents paths, black represents
  walls.<br />
- All mazes are surrounded entirely by black walls.<br />
- One white square exists on the top row of the image, and is the start
  of the maze.<br />
- One white square exists on the bottom row of the image, and is the end
  of the maze.  </p>
<p>There are some example mazes in the ./img directory.</p>
