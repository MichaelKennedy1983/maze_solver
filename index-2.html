<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>A short program which solves mazes using various algorithms and written
in Rust. It is adapted from Dr. Mike Pound's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rop0W4QDOUI">video</a>
for Computerphile and Python <a href="https://github.com/mikepound/mazesolving">code</a>.
My goal with this project was to practice using the Rust language and reacquaint myself with search algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="build">Build</h2>
<p>Assuming Rust's build tool and package manager, Cargo, is already
installed:
1. clone repository
2. change directory to the clone repository
3. run 'cargo build' in the repository directory</p>
